**To Implement:**
- MPSC (not to be confused with MPMC).
- Implement SPMC (not to be confused with SPSC).
- Move source files to an src/ subdirectory.
- Expand the docker-jenkins CI to test against other lisp implementations.
- add verbose debug logging for docker-jenkins CI errors.
- Benchmark on other hardware via google cloud VM's, and document extensively in the Wiki.
